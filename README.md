# ALTERSHAPER Bot - ALTER EGO Wiki Moderation Bot

A lawful angel Discord moderator—speaks in pseudo-biblical English. Has utilities to link an account with a wiki account, and give out appropriate roles. Also a bunch of fun commands such as `/aura` and `/battle`.

Extensive documentation will be found here: https://alter-ego.fandom.com/wiki/Help:ALTERSHAPER

## Features

- **Moderation**: `/kick`, `/ban`, `/timeout`, `/warn`
- **Management**: `/clear` with message archiving, `/removesin` for punishment reversal
- **Information**: `/sins` for records, `/archives` for deleted messages, `/help` for well, help lol
- **Auto-welcome** new members
- **Action IDs** for moderation & management commands (e.g. W1, K1, B1, T1, C1)

## Setup

1. `npm install`
2. Create `.env` with `DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token`
3. `npm run build`
